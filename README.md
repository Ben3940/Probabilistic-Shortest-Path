# Project Background


# Project Goal

Given a graph (G), the algorithm will traverse from a start node (S) to an end node (E) in the fewest number of "hops".  A hop is counted for each node the algorithm passes through while traversing G.  Two different apporaches to the algorithm will be use and compared: a bread-first-search (BFS) and a depth-first-search (DFS) approach.  The BFS approach will be the deterministic approach and the "benchmark" to compare the probabilistic DFS approach.
